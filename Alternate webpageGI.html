    <h4><strong>Gentle Leader:</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Barrett wears a red strap over his nose called a gentle leader. This is not a muzzle and he can open his mouth fully. It is used to prevent Barrett from pulling on his leash by cutting his power in half as he pulls on his own nose. This <em>does not</em> hurt him.

    <p>
      Open and close doors using tug rope, push buttons, turn light switches on and off, open the fridge and take something out  then close it and bring item, fetch objects, find a scented phone, tell a secret, give kisses, obedience commands.

  <h4><strong> Grooming: </strong></h4>
    <p>
      Every three months Barrett gets a full bath. His coat is brushed everyday, and so are his teeth. He gets mushers wax massaged into his paws to protect them. Once a week he gets his ears cleaned. Once a month he gets his nails clipped.
