  <h1>Training</h1>
  <p>Barrett was trained by an organization called NEADS which trains many types of assistance dogs. When Barrett was two months old he started his training which took place in a prison and was done by prison inmates, who were trained by professional trainers. He lived in the prison during the week, and then on weekends he was furloughed to a weekend puppy raiser who socialized him. When he was 18 months old, he was matched and has now been with his partner for almost 6 months.
