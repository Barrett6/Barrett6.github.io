          <h4><strong>Gentle Leader:</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Barrett wears a red strap over his nose called a gentle leader. This is not a muzzle and he can open his mouth fully. It is used to prevent Barrett from pulling on his leash by cutting his power in half as he pulls on his own nose. This <em>does not</em> hurt him.

        <h4><strong> Abilities: </strong></h4>
          <p>

        <h4><strong> Grooming: </strong></h4>
          <p>
            Every three months Barrett gets a full bath. His coat is brushed everyday, and so are his teeth. He gets mushers wax massaged into his paws to protect them. Once a week he gets his ears cleaned. Once a month he gets his nails clipped.
          </p>

        <h3><strong> Training </strong></h3>
          <p>Barrett was trained by an organization called NEADS which trains many types of assistance dogs. When Barrett was two months old he started his training which took place in a prison and was done by prison inmates, who were trained by professional trainers. He lived in the prison during the week, and then on weekends he was furloughed to a weekend puppy raiser who socialized him. When he was 18 months old, he was matched and has now been with his partner for almost 6 months.
